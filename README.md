This project uses EMNIST Balanced dataset and CNN to predict the digits drawn on a live canvas using streamlit.

the model architecture contains 3 blocks of CNN and 1 fully connected block

the model has an accuracy of 89.5%, which was achieved by using:
    1) Data Augmentation
    2) Learning Rate Scheduling
    3) Early Stopping
    4) higher epochs (35)
